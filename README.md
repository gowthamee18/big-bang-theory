# Rock Paper Scissors (The Big Bang Theory Version)

You must’ve played Rock Paper Scissors a couple of times.  
But have you ever played **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock**?

If you’ve watched *The Big Bang Theory* and are a fan of **Sheldon Cooper**, chances are you might’ve heard about it—or even played it while declaring,  
> “**Spock vaporizes rock**!” 🖖💥🪨

This game was inspired by a hilariously geeky scene from *The Big Bang Theory* where Sheldon invents this delightful twist on the classic game.  
Wanna relive that legendary moment?  
**Check out the scene here:** [Watch on YouTube 🎬](https://youtu.be/iSHPVCBsnLw?si=0Hj6Fe1s-aGmSeZQ)

## 🎮 What Is This?

This is a Python-based terminal game where you:
- Choose your move (Rock ✊, Paper ✋, Scissors ✌🏻, Lizard 🦎, or Spock 🖖)
- Battle it out with a randomly generated computer choice
- See who wins—and get rewarded (or consoled) with the cutest ASCII cat faces based on the outcome 🐱

## 🧠 Rules (Straight from the mind of Sheldon Cooper):

- Scissors cut Paper ✂️✋  
- Paper covers Rock ✋🪨  
- Rock crushes Lizard 🪨🦎  
- Lizard poisons Spock 🦎🖖  
- Spock smashes Scissors 🖖✂️  
- Scissors decapitate Lizard ✂️🦎  
- Lizard eats Paper 🦎✋  
- Paper disproves Spock ✋🖖  
- Spock vaporizes Rock 🖖🪨  
- Rock crushes Scissors 🪨✂️  

It’s not just a game… it’s science. (Kinda.)

## 💡 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.  
Then open your terminal and run:

```bash
python bigbangthoery.py
```
Alternatively, you can download the `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) file and run it in your favorite Python environment!

- I used **Google Colab** to create and test this (super beginner friendly and no installation needed!)  
- You can also use **VS Code**, **JupyterLab**, or any Python IDE you’re comfortable with.

  
## 😺 Bonus Feature

Depending on whether you **win**, **lose**, or **draw**,  
a cat will either:

- 😻 **Smile like a goofball**  
- 😿 **Cry softly**  
- 😼 **Stare in utter confusion**

Because emotional support cats make everything better. 💖
